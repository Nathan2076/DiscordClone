**Disclaimer: this project is aimed for front-end-training purposes only and does not intend to replace, compete with, or fake the original Discord app, lead anyone to believe that, or pretend to be the Original in order to scam, track or get users' personal data. This is a fan project made for fun with the unique purpose of skill training.**


## Copyright

Both Discord brand and support emails were contacted prior to the public release asking for upload permissions, but no responses were given. If you are part of the Discord team and this project has reached you by any means, please contact and this project will be removed from public access immediately.


## Licensing & asset usage

Reproduction or usage outside this repository is not permitted. Visuals and technical things — including icons/SVGs, sizes, spacing, colors, and fonts — were taken from the original app and their code was simplified to the minimum. However, the Discord logo and main colors are available on [their official branding webpage & media kit](https://discord.com/branding), and are used from there instead, where applicable.

**The Discord brand, logo, symbol, wordmark, taglines, and characters are trademarks of Discord, Inc. and its affiliates.**
